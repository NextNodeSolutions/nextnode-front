# NextNode 1.2.0 - Serverless Functions

We are thrilled to introduce NextNode Functions, our serverless computing platform that runs your code at the edge.

## NextNode Functions

### What Are Functions?

Functions are lightweight, event-driven compute units that execute in response to HTTP requests, scheduled events, or other triggers. They scale automatically from zero to thousands of instances.

### Key Features

- **Edge execution** in 50+ locations worldwide
- **Sub-10ms cold starts** for instant responses
- **TypeScript and JavaScript** support out of the box
- **Integrated logging** and error tracking
- **Environment variables** inherited from your project

### Example Function

```typescript
export default async function handler(request: Request) {
	const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
	const name = searchParams.get('name') || 'World'

	return new Response(`Hello, ${name}!`, {
		headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
	})
}
```

## Cron Jobs

Schedule your functions to run on a recurring basis:

- Minutely, hourly, daily, or custom cron expressions
- Automatic retries on failure
- Execution history and logs
- Timezone-aware scheduling

## Edge Config

Store and access configuration at the edge with zero latency:

- Key-value storage replicated globally
- Instant propagation of updates
- SDK support for all runtimes

## Pricing

Functions are billed per invocation with a generous free tier:

- **Free**: 100,000 invocations/month
- **Pro**: 1,000,000 invocations/month included
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited invocations
