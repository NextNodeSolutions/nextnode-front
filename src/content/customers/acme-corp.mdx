## From Manual Deployments to Cloud-Native Excellence

When Acme Corporation began their digital transformation journey, they faced a common challenge: their legacy deployment process was holding back innovation. Every release required a full weekend of dedicated engineering time, and even then, issues frequently occurred.

### The Challenge

The engineering team at Acme was spending over 30% of their time on deployment-related tasks:

- Manual server provisioning for each new service
- Complex load balancer configurations
- Inconsistent environments between staging and production
- Limited visibility into system performance

### The Solution

After evaluating several platforms, Acme chose NextNode for its comprehensive approach to modern deployment:

```typescript
// Example NextNode configuration that powers Acme's deployments
export default {
	name: 'acme-api',
	regions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1', 'ap-southeast-1'],
	scaling: {
		min: 2,
		max: 50,
		metric: 'cpu',
		target: 70,
	},
}
```

The migration was completed in just six weeks, with zero downtime during the transition.

### Results

Since adopting NextNode, Acme has seen remarkable improvements across all key metrics. Their engineering team now ships features twice as fast, and customer satisfaction scores have reached all-time highs.

> The ROI we've seen from NextNode has exceeded our expectations. It's not just a deployment platform—it's a competitive advantage.
