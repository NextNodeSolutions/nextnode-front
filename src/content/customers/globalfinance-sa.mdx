## Securing the Future of Finance

GlobalFinance SA operates at the intersection of tradition and innovation. As a century-old financial institution embracing digital transformation, they required infrastructure that could handle both the regulatory demands of banking and the agility needed for modern fintech services.

### The Challenge

Financial services face unique infrastructure challenges:

- Strict data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions
- Continuous regulatory audits (FINMA, GDPR, SOX)
- Real-time transaction processing with zero tolerance for latency
- Advanced threat protection against sophisticated cyber attacks

### The Solution

NextNode Enterprise provided GlobalFinance with a comprehensive platform designed for regulated industries:

```yaml
# GlobalFinance multi-region deployment configuration
regions:
    - name: eu-central-1
      primary: true
      compliance: [gdpr, finma]
      data_residency: strict
    - name: ap-southeast-1
      compliance: [mas, pdpa]
      data_residency: strict
    - name: us-east-1
      compliance: [sox, ccpa]
      data_residency: strict

security:
    encryption: aes-256-gcm
    key_management: customer_managed
    audit_logging: immutable
    access_control: rbac_with_mfa
```

Every transaction is encrypted, logged, and auditable—exactly what regulators require.

### Regulatory Excellence

The partnership with NextNode has transformed how GlobalFinance approaches compliance:

- **Automated Evidence Collection**: Audit logs and compliance reports are generated automatically
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Security dashboards provide instant visibility into all systems
- **Incident Response**: Automated threat detection and response procedures

> Our last regulatory audit took three weeks instead of the usual three months. The examiners were impressed by the level of detail and automation in our compliance documentation.

— _Dr. Elena Rodriguez, CISO_

- Launched a mobile banking app serving 500,000 users
- Deployed AI-powered fraud detection processing 10,000 transactions per second
