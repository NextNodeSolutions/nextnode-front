## From Garage to Growth: A Startup Success Story

TechStart Inc represents the next generation of SaaS companies—lean, fast-moving, and laser-focused on delivering value to customers. Their choice of NextNode as their infrastructure platform has been central to their rapid growth.

### The Challenge

With just three engineers and explosive user growth, TechStart faced a critical decision:

- Hire expensive DevOps specialists and slow down product development
- Continue with manual deployments and risk stability
- Find a platform that would grow with them

### The Solution

NextNode offered TechStart the best of both worlds: enterprise reliability without the enterprise overhead.

```javascript
// TechStart's serverless analytics pipeline
import { NextNode } from '@nextnode/sdk'

export const analyzeVisitor = NextNode.function({
	name: 'analyze-visitor',
	runtime: 'nodejs20',
	memory: 256,
	timeout: 30,
	handler: async event => {
		// Process analytics in real-time
		return processVisitorData(event.body)
	},
})
```

The platform handles over 50 million events per day with automatic scaling and zero manual intervention.

### Growth Without Limits

Since deploying on NextNode, TechStart has:

- Scaled from 200 to 2,000+ customers
- Maintained 99.95% uptime through Black Friday traffic spikes
- Expanded to serve customers in 40+ countries
- Passed SOC 2 compliance audit on the first attempt

> We looked at building our own infrastructure, but it would have taken us a year to get where NextNode got us in a week. That's a year of product development we would have lost.

— _Marcus Webb, CTO_

### What's Next

TechStart is now preparing for their Series A, with NextNode infrastructure supporting their ambitious growth plans. Their technical due diligence was a breeze—investors were impressed by the robustness of their setup.
