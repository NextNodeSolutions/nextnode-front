# Account Security

Protecting your NextNode account is crucial for securing your deployments and team data.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA for all accounts.

### Setting Up 2FA

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
4. Enter the 6-digit code to verify
5. Save your backup codes securely

### Supported Authenticator Apps

- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- 1Password
- Bitwarden

### Backup Codes

After enabling 2FA, you receive 10 backup codes. Store these securely:

- Each code can only be used once
- Use them if you lose access to your authenticator
- Generate new codes anytime from Security settings

## Session Management

### Viewing Active Sessions

Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **Active Sessions** to see:

- All devices logged into your account
- Location and IP address
- Last active time

### Revoking Sessions

If you see suspicious activity:

1. Click **Revoke** next to the session
2. Or use **Revoke All** to log out everywhere

## API Tokens

### Creating Secure Tokens

When creating API tokens:

```bash
# Use descriptive names
nextnode-ci-github-actions
nextnode-deploy-staging

# Set expiration dates
# Never share tokens in code
```

### Token Permissions

Limit token permissions to only what is needed:

- **Read**: View projects and deployments
- **Write**: Create deployments
- **Admin**: Manage team and billing

## Security Best Practices

### Do

- Use unique, strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Regularly review active sessions
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Rotate API tokens periodically

### Do Not

- Share login credentials
- Commit API tokens to repositories
- Use the same password across services
- Leave sessions active on shared devices

## Security Alerts

NextNode sends alerts for:

- New device logins
- Failed login attempts
- Password changes
- 2FA changes

Configure alerts in **Settings** → **Notifications**.
