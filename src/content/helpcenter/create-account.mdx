# How to Create an Account

Creating a NextNode account is quick and easy. Follow these steps to get started.

## Sign Up Methods

NextNode supports multiple authentication methods:

- **GitHub** - Recommended for open source projects
- **GitLab** - Great for self-hosted repositories
- **Bitbucket** - Perfect for Atlassian ecosystem users
- **Email** - Available for enterprise customers

## Creating Your Account

### Option 1: Sign Up with GitHub (Recommended)

1. Go to [nextnode.dev/signup](https://nextnode.dev/signup)
2. Click **Continue with GitHub**
3. Authorize NextNode to access your account
4. Grant repository access (you can limit to specific repos)

### Option 2: Sign Up with Email

1. Go to [nextnode.dev/signup](https://nextnode.dev/signup)
2. Enter your email address
3. Create a secure password (minimum 12 characters)
4. Verify your email address

## Setting Up Your Profile

After creating your account:

1. **Add your name** - This appears in team invitations
2. **Upload a profile photo** - Optional but recommended
3. **Set your timezone** - For accurate deployment timestamps
4. **Enable 2FA** - Strongly recommended for security

## Account Verification

For security purposes, we may require verification for:

- First deployments
- Team creation
- Billing changes

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot access repositories

Make sure you have granted NextNode the required permissions in your Git provider settings.

### Email not received

Check your spam folder. If still not received, try resending or contact support.
