## About Sophie

Sophie Bernard leads the platform team at NextNode, responsible for building the tools and SDKs that developers use every day. Her focus on developer experience has been instrumental in making NextNode one of the most loved platforms in the ecosystem.

### What Sophie Builds

As Lead Developer, Sophie oversees:

- **NextNode CLI** - The command-line interface for deploying and managing edge functions
- **JavaScript SDK** - Type-safe client library with excellent DX
- **API Design** - RESTful and GraphQL APIs that developers love
- **Documentation** - Interactive docs and tutorials

### Code Philosophy

```typescript
// Sophie's approach to API design
// Clear, predictable, and hard to misuse

interface DeployOptions {
	// Required fields first
	projectId: string
	environment: 'production' | 'staging' | 'preview'

	// Sensible defaults for optional fields
	timeout?: number // defaults to 30s
	region?: Region // defaults to 'auto'
}
```

- Runs weekly office hours for NextNode users

- Reviews and responds to GitHub issues personally
- Writes tutorials and best practice guides

### Open Source
