## About Jean

Jean Martin is the technical mastermind behind NextNode's edge computing platform. With deep expertise in distributed systems, container orchestration, and network protocols, he architects the infrastructure that powers millions of requests per second.

### Technical Expertise

Jean's areas of specialization include:

- **Distributed Systems** - Consensus algorithms, eventual consistency, CRDT
- **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes, edge deployments, multi-region
- **Network Protocols** - HTTP/3, WebTransport, QUIC
- **Systems Programming** - Rust, Go, and performance optimization

### Open Source Contributions

Jean is an active contributor to several major open source projects:

```bash
# Some of Jean's notable contributions
- Kubernetes SIG-Network maintainer
- Envoy Proxy contributor
- Created the edge-runtime project (2.5k+ stars)
```

### Engineering Philosophy

> "The best infrastructure is invisible. When developers don't have to think about scaling, latency, or failover, that's when we've done our job right."

Jean believes in building systems that are simple to use but sophisticated under the hood. This philosophy drives every technical decision at NextNode.

### Patents & Publications

Jean holds 12 patents in distributed systems and has published numerous papers on edge computing, including the influential "Rethinking the Edge" whitepaper that helped define the modern edge computing paradigm.
